1. What is the difference between an adaptive website and a fully responsive website?

Adaptive and responsive design are similar, but responsive design prefers %s to hard-coded pixels and allows for more 
fluidity and control across devices. 

2. Describe what it means to be mobile first vs desktop first.

Designing for a mobile site means your media queries will use "(min-width: [value])" rather than "(max-width: [value])". 
Or in other words—you start small and get bigger. 

3. What does font-size: 62.5% in the html tag do for us when using rem units?

This makes our font responsive to the user. 1rem will equal 10px. 

4. How would you describe preprocessing to someone new to CSS?

Preprocessing is a more efficient way to write and organize CSS. 

5. What is your favorite concept in preprocessing? What is the concept that gives you the most trouble?

No favorite concept in particular. On a large project I'd probably better understand and appreciate its efficiency, 
but within the scope of what we're doing it's  just another way to write CSS. It doesn't look more "legible" or "clean" to me. 
It's all brackets and symbols either way.  -->

      <p>As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size of a marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so delicate, that if you touched it with a finger it would fall apart. Seeing this has to change a man.</p>

      <p>Never in all their history have men been able truly to conceive of the world as one: a single sphere, a globe, having the qualities of a globe, a round earth in which all the directions eventually meet.</p>
    
      <p>Which there is no center because every point, or none, is center — an equal earth which all men occupy as equals. The airman's earth, if free men make it.</p>

        <p>The Earth was small, light blue, and so touchingly alone, our home that must be defended like a holy relic. The Earth was absolutely round.</p>
      
        <p>Suddenly struck me that that tiny pea, pretty and blue, was the Earth. I put up my thumb and shut one eye, and my thumb blotted out the planet Earth.</p>
